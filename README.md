# SentMinePack - Modpack for minecraft 1.12.2


Server for the modpack - https://github.com/Senteris/SentMinePack-server


This modpack has few mods created for comfortable and hard survival. You should not have a "super cool server with 312TB RAM and 128 core processor" anymore. Just pregenerate the world and enjoy.


The modpack has magic, rpg and cosmic mods for new adventures. There are complicated crafts of some things and a lot of new mobs! Fight and be carefully... They are everywhere!


For comfortable game you need just 2GB RAM. If your server have not 2GB RAM, delete mod "chunkpregeneratorv1.12-2.2.jar" and downgrade your settings at settings.bat(or settings.sh) and server.properties.
